## About
Our project focuses on the agricultural sector and aims to contribute to the solution of some challenges in this area. In this context, we identified several pain points that our solution can help solve, such as low crop productivity due to lack of optimization in the use of available resources and inefficient farming practices, which also leads to low profitability for farmers, lack of automation of farming operations (such as irrigation) and lack of data availability to improve knowledge-based decision making. Technology can contribute to improving these conditions, however, in the context of agriculture in our region, its adoption can be a challenge, especially for small producers, so our solution takes this situation into account by offering a product that is easy to use and implement at an affordable cost. 

## Features
The main functionality of our solution is the collection, management, and storage of crop weather data. This data is useful for the improvement of agricultural practices, such as the generation of early warnings, better pest management and crop control automation. We used Huawei Cloud resources to develop a solution that includes: 

- An IoT device for crop monitoring
- A crop yield prediction system based on historical data
- Extreme weather alerts on crops
- A web application for accessing device information, alerts and graphs
- A farmer assistance IVR
